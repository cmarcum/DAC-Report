The `r params$dac` Data Access Committee (DAC) currently manages `r total.number.of.dars` data access requests (DARs) for access to `r total.number.of.projects` projects in dbGaP.  

# Data Access Requests
Between `r params$start.date` and `r params$end.date` the DAC reviewed `r num.dars.in.window` DARs. Of these, `r number.of.accepted` were accepted while `r number.of.rejected` were rejected.  The average amount of time from when the Principle Investigator (PI) submited a DAR to the final decision by the DAC was `r avg.final` days.  The average time to an accepted decision was `r avg.accept` days, while the average time to a rejected decision was `r avg.reject` days.  Figure \@ref(fig:compline) is a barplot comparing the `r params$dac` DAC to time to final decision to the average across all NIH DACs during the same time interval.  

```{r compline, fig.cap="Comparison of Time to Final Decision", echo=FALSE}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(1:4) #call data and plot here
